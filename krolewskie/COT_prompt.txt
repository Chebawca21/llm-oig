For the following task implement the solution using Python 3.7 and numpy library.

Task description:
Wiktoria is investigating the properties of royal numbers. These are non-negative integers in which the binary representation contains an even number of ones. Help the girl at work and write a program for her that will find the k-th royal number.

Input:
The first line of standard input contains a number t (1 <= t <= 10^5), indicating the number of queries. In each of the following lines of input, there is an integer ki (1 <= ki <= 10^9), indicating a question about the k-th royal number.

Output:
In t lines of standard output, there should be answers to the queries in the order given in the input.

Sample input:
2
2
3

Sample output:
The program should read 2 numbers, in this case, they are 2 and 3. The output should contain the second and third royal numbers. Having a ready list of royal numbers, you need to check which one is the second and which one is the third. The first royal number is 0, the second is 11 (binary) or 3 (decimal), the third is 101 (binary) or 5 (decimal). Therefore, the program should print the numbers 3 and 5.
