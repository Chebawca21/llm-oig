You are starting in the Olympiad in Informatics. You will need to write a code in Python 3.7 using numpy library that will solve the task below in the most optimal way. Besides the task you have description of the data you should espect in the input and data format for the output. Also you can look at the example and solution for it. Good luck!

Task description:
Krystian needs to hang laundry, but the household dryer is already overloaded and there is no space on it. The boy decided to take n wooden stakes with heights x1, . . . , xn and drove them into the ground one after another at equal intervals. Then he looked at each pair of stakes with numbers i < j. If all stakes between i and j were lower than min(xi, xj), Krystian stretched a string between i and j at a height of min(xi, xj) – in such a way that it ran parallel to the ground. The boy was so proud of his idea and work that he took a commemorative photo. Now he is trying to count how many strings he hung. Help him with this task!

Input:
The first line of standard input contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 200,000). The second line contains a sequence of integers x1, . . . , xn (1 <= xi <= n).

Output:
The output should contain a single integer – the number of strings visible in Krystian's photo.

Example input:
5
1 2 2 2 1

Way to solve:
With 5 stakes, you need to check every possible pair of these stakes for the possibility of hanging a string. Pairs will be checked from left to right, so in this case, there are 10 different pairs: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4). Analyzing the heights of the stakes occurring between them according to the criterion for hanging a string, where each stake in between should be lower than the lower stake of the pair, strings will be hung for the following pairs: (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4). Thus, 4 strings will be hung.

Example output:
4
