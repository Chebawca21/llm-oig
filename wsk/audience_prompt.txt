You are starting in the Olympiad in Informatics. You will need to write a code in Python 3.7 using numpy library that will solve the task below in the most optimal way. Besides the task you have description of the data you should espect in the input and data format for the output. Also you can look at the example and solution for it. Good luck!

Task description:
Hirsch's index reflects the distribution of citations of a specific scientist and the number of his best publications. According to Hirsch himself:
A scientist has an index h if h of his publications have at least h citations each.
Mrs. Marta has decided to start her scientific career. She has determined that in the near future, she could write n different scientific articles. Mrs. Marta knows exactly how many days it would take her to write each article and what citation index she could achieve for each publication. Your task is to calculate, for a given d, the maximum Hirsch index Mrs. Marta could achieve after d days of scientific work.

Input:
The first line of standard input contains two integers n and t (1 <= n, t <= 200,000). In the next n lines, there are pairs of integers x, y (1 <= x <= n; 1 <= y <= 10^9), indicating, respectively, how many citations a given work would receive and how much time it takes to write it. In the next t lines, one number z (1 <= z <= 10^15) is written in each line, indicating the amount of time for each query. In 80% of the tests, an additional condition is satisfied (1 <= t <= 20).

Output:
In t lines of standard output, you should print for each query the maximum Hirsch index that Mrs. Marta could achieve in at most z seconds.

Sample input:
6 3
3 100
2 200
1 300
4 100
4 200
5 500
300
400
500

Sample output:
2
3
